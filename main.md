# About Carbon Footprint

Carbon footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), that are emitted directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, event, product, or service. These emissions contribute to climate change by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and associated environmental impacts.

# Ways To Reduce Carbon Footprint

->   Use energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs.
